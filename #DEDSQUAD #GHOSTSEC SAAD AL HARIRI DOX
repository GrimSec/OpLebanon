 saad al hariri prime minister of Lebanon is a corrupted politician and same to all political leaders in Lebanon so we are going to do this one by one
starting with Mr.Hariri and his actions towards Lebanon
 
him and all politicians have been pocketing from peoples money
political sectarianism
proxy conflicts instead of unifying the country
Lack of healthcare and not trying to solve this issue
Lack of public transport also hasnt been trying to solve
Lack of funding and resource for education (people cant learn)
no electricity with constant blackouts
no clean water
air pollution is causing disease and death
enviro disaster caused by amplified garbage
alrdy low wages not being paid
corrupt business (soon our target also stay tuned)
no care for the elderly
people are starving (less then 1.90$/day and they wanna tax 20 cents per whatsapp message)
massive government debt (70-86 billion)
